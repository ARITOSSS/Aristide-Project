# Weekly Report 6

## **Time spent on the project :**
15 Hours

## **What have you done this week ?**
This week, I spent more time on my project than usual, clocking in around 15 hours. There were significant changes. I fixed the issues with my Double Set Single Point (DSSP) algorithm as it wasn’t yielding good results. To address this, I re-implemented it from scratch and thoroughly re-read the thesis to ensure I didn’t miss anything crucial.

I also decided to remove my Naive Single Point (NSP) algorithm since it had an unresolved issue and I didn’t want to waste time fixing it. In addition, I completed all my tests and achieved 100% coverage (excluding the GUI). I made sure that my code passed Pylint checks with minimal issues and thoroughly commented all the code.

I also finished all the pending documentation and set up a `main` function that tracks the game's progression with terminal output to ensure consistency. Additionally, I created a `statistics` file that runs code and writes the results to the `Testing_Document` in markdown format.

The project has progressed significantly and is now complete. There are a few minor improvements that could be added, but the core objectives are done.

## **How has the project progressed ?**
The project is now finished and in a solid state. The DSSP algorithm is working as expected, and all tests are complete with 100% coverage (excluding the GUI). Pylint checks are clean, and both the code and documentation are well-commented. The project's main logic has been implemented, and the necessary files for statistical output are in place.

## **What did you learn this week ?**
I didn’t learn anything particularly new this week. Most of the work was implementing things I already understood. The focus was more on refining and completing the project rather than acquiring new knowledge.

## **What has been unclear or problematic ?**
Nothing was unclear or problematic this week. The tasks were straightforward, though time-consuming.

## **What’s next ?**
As the project is complete, I have no immediate tasks left. However, if I have free time outside of this course, I might try implementing a version using Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) to make the project more comprehensive. This could be useful for my future CVs.
