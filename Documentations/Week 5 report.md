# Weekly Report 5

## **Time spent on the project :**
10 Hours

## **What have you done this week ?**
This week, I had to re-implement the entire project from scratch because my original Minesweeper game design did not align with the approach taken in the Harvard student's study, which led to issues when implementing the solving algorithms. After revising the implementation, I had to re-run Pylint checks and restart work on the tests. Fortunately, understanding the algorithms better this time allowed me to quickly modify the entire project.

Now, both the Naive Single Point and Double Set Single Point algorithms are implemented.

I've also started working on documentation such as the ReadMe or the implementation document.

## **How has the project progressed ?**
The project is now back on track after the re-implementation. Both solving algorithms are functioning correctly, and the project structure is solid. With Pylint done, I now just need to focus on testing and documentation to complete the project. The rework allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the algorithms, so I'm confident moving forward.

## **What did you learn this week ?**
This week, I learned the importance of thoroughly reading and understanding the problem statement before diving into development. Had I followed the correct implementation from the start, I could have saved significant time. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of how the algorithms function and how to properly implement them.

Some Markdown tricks.

## **What has been unclear or problematic ?**
I’m uncertain about a few things, particularly the tests involving the graphical interface. Are they mandatory? I'm also having a bit of trouble implementing a hand that compares the two algorithms.

## **What’s next ?**

- Redo all the tests
- Implement a main function that compares the performance of the two algorithms
- Working on documentation documents

### If I have time :

- Make the graphical interface more engaging
- Improve the main function to simulate and display multiple games more effectively
- Explore using a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) approach to enhance the solver

## **Questions :**
Are graphical interface tests necessary?
