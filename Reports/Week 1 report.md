# Weekly Report 1

## **Time spent on the project :**
5 Hours

## **Choosing a project and understanding the issues at stake :**

This week, I started by selecting my project from among the subjects on offer. Before making my choice, I took the time to thoroughly review the other project options to ensure that I was making the best decision aligned with my interests and skills. After careful consideration, I got in touch with a teacher to gain a better understanding of the expectations and challenges of the chosen project, which helped me to orientate myself more effectively. The discussions were invaluable in clarifying the objectives of the project and identifying the methodologies to be adopted.

## **Study of Algorithms and Methodologies :**

I spent part of my time learning about the algorithms and methodologies needed for my project, in particular the DSSP (Double Set Single Point) and CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) algorithms. Although I was already familiar with playing Minesweeper, I took the time to explore how the game functions from a more mathematical and algorithmic perspective. This deeper understanding is crucial as these algorithms will be essential for the implementation of my Minesweeper solver, and I have already started to draw up a plan for integrating them into the project.

## **Exploring Graphical Interface Options :**

Having never created a GUI before, I've been researching the various libraries available for developing one efficiently. I explored options such as Tkinter, PyQt, and Kivy to choose the solution best suited to my needs. During my research, I also found several examples online that will help me implement an interface more easily, allowing me to save time and focus more on the algorithmic part of the project. This approach gave me a better understanding of the possibilities and constraints of each tool, setting a solid foundation for the next steps.

## **Learning Test Methods in Python :**

 I took the time to familiarise myself with testing practices in Python, by exploring frameworks such as unittest and pytest. The aim is to be able to integrate tests throughout development to guarantee the quality and reliability of the code.

## **Action plan :**

I haven't started coding yet, but I have a structured plan in place. The first stage will be to develop the graphical interface and define the necessary data structures. Then I'll move on to implementing the algorithms and gradually integrating the tests. 

## **Challenges and grey areas :**

The most complex part of this week has been understanding in detail the specifics of the DSSP and CSP algorithms and planning their application to the project. There are still areas of uncertainty, particularly with regard to implement these algorithms for my specific context. In addition, setting up tests is a new area for me, and I expect to encounter some challenges along the way.

## **Specification document :**

I dedicated a significant amount of time to working on the Specification Document, which was a crucial step in the process. Although it took longer than expected, this effort allowed me to gain a comprehensive understanding of my project. By clearly defining the objectives, requirements, and expected outcomes, I was able to set a solid direction for the development phase, ensuring that I have a well-structured approach moving forward.

## **Conclusion and Next Steps :**

The next steps will be to finalise the choice of tools for the graphical interface and to start developing it. At the same time, I will continue to deepen my knowledge of testing algorithms and methodologies to ensure the smooth and structured development of my solveu project. My aim is to finalise the interface this weekend, or next week if it takes longer, so that I can concentrate on the algorithmic aspects of the project.
